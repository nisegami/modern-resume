  name: Active Safety for Autonomous Vehicles
  dates: August 2017 – December 2018
  description: |
    - Part of the Virtually Integrated Projects program at Georgia Tech. Students from a variety of majors worked together to develop platforms to test and improve self-driving cars.
    - I worked with the team that created and maintained a simulation software for self-driving and human-driven cars. The simulation software was used to conduct research on how humans interact with other cars and evaluate their trust in self-driving cars.
    - I focused my efforts on adding Virtual Reality support to the simulator, to increase immersion and produce results that better reflect the real world. I used the Oculus platform to accomplish this.
