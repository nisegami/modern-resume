    Principle Developer of a replacement system for an Access Database used by the Educational Planning Division
      - Current system uses Microsoft Access and has not been updated to reflect the needs of the Division in at least 10 years. 
      - Purpose of the system was to store and report on data obtained from schools yearly. 
      - Replacement system improves in several key ways:
        - Split into a REST API backend and Web SPA frontend.
          - Backend written in Python using the FastAPI and SQLAlchemy libraries.
          - Frontend written in Javascript using the Vue framework and Vuex, Vue-Router and Vuetify libraries. 
        - Object modelling placed an emphasis on adaptability to reflect changing needs over time, allowing the system to adapt over time. 
        - Replacement system placed a great emphasis on preventing errors:
          - Excel documents (the current form of the survey) are read automatically, freeing up staff resources and eliminating data entry errors.
          - All data provided to the system is checked for consistency and errors are flagged and reported.
          - As of August 2020, my system was able to identify over 4000 outstanding errors in the surveys collected for the 2019-2020 academic year and provide a report on errors at the school and district level.

    Participated in the following committees, providing technical expertise:
      - Remote Learning Policy Creation Committee
